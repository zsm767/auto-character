# auto-character
Small project for creating a randomized character generator, based off vanilla 5e DnD stats, skills, races, etc.

## **TO-DO: Everything lol**

##### Hopefully, documenting this will help me straighten out my thoughts...

This is primarily going to be broken down into smaller classes in order to handle the different aspects of making a character 
(i.e. a Roller class in order to handle rolling die of different sizes, CharClass in order to handle character classes, and so on)

For now, a basic list of planned features:
- [ x ] Create and test out the DiceRoller class. Make sure it's pretty random with the rolls. 
- [ ] Consider how abstracted you want this to be. Should multiple parts of the character's information (Skills, Stats, Name, etc.) be separated into separate classes? Or nah, clump it all together. It's worth thinking about.
- [ ] (Down the road) Output of the data? GUI kind of deal, CLI-looking, file?
